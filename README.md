## **About the Project**  
The **Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI tool that provides insights into the top 10 companies from the NASDAQ-100 index. The dashboard highlights stock trends, trading volumes, and key performance metrics.  

Additionally, the project features a machine learning model that uses **XGBoost regression** to forecast stock prices for the next seven days. Real-time stock data is fetched dynamically using the `yfinance` library, ensuring up-to-date analysis for decision-makers.

### **Companies Analyzed**  
- Amazon  
- Apple  
- Meta (Facebook)  
- PayPal  
- Cisco  
- Microsoft  
- Google (Alphabet)  
- Intel Corporation  
- Tesla  
- NVIDIA

## **Project Objectives**  
1. Provide a comprehensive visualization of key metrics and trends in the NASDAQ-100 stock market.  
2. Leverage machine learning to predict future stock prices.  
3. Enable dynamic updates in the dashboard using cloud-based data sources.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Power BI**: Interactive visualizations and insights.  
- **Python**: Data fetching, preprocessing, and machine learning.  
- **yfinance**: Real-time stock data fetching.  
- **scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and model evaluation.  
- **XGBoost**: Regression model for stock price prediction.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Python scripts embedded in Power BI for real-time updates.  

---

## **Data Source**  
Historical stock data was fetched using the `yfinance` library, covering daily stock performance from 1984 to the present. The dataset includes:  
- Opening and closing prices  
- High and low prices  
- Trading volume  
- Adjusted prices  

---

## **Dashboard Features**  
1. **Dynamic Data Integration**: Real-time updates via embedded Python scripts.  
2. **Interactive Visualizations**:  
   - Stock price trends (daily, weekly, monthly).  
   - Trading volume comparisons.  
   - Performance rankings based on percentage changes.  
3. **Forecasting**: Predicted stock prices for the next seven days.  
4. **Detailed Insights**: Drill-through functionality for company-specific performance.  
5. **Cross-Filtering**: Seamless interaction between visualizations for exploratory analysis.  

---

## **Machine Learning Model**  
The machine learning pipeline utilizes an **XGBoost regression** model for forecasting.  

### **Model Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handling missing values and outliers.  
   - Feature normalization for improved model accuracy.  
2. **Model Training and Validation**:  
   - Training the model on historical stock data.  
   - Evaluating performance using RMSE and MAE metrics.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning for robust predictions.  
3. **Integration with Power BI**:  
   - Embedding Python scripts to dynamically display forecasts.  

---

## **How the Dashboard Works**  
1. **Data Fetching**:  
   - Python scripts fetch live and historical stock data via the `yfinance` library.  
2. **Data Processing**:  
   - Preprocessed data is input into the XGBoost model for predictions.  
3. **Dynamic Updates**:  
   - Embedded Python scripts refresh data and visuals in Power BI automatically.  
4. **User Interaction**:  
   - Filters for company, time range, and performance metrics enable granular exploration.  

---

## **Challenges Faced**  
1. **Large Data Volume**: Efficiently managing stock data spanning over three decades.  
2. **Python-Power BI Integration**: Embedding Python scripts for real-time updates.  
3. **Forecast Accuracy**: Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency for the XGBoost model.  

---

## **Testing and Validation**  
- The machine learning model was validated using RMSE and MAE metrics to ensure accurate predictions.  
- The dashboard was rigorously tested for responsiveness, data accuracy, and cross-device compatibility.  

---

## **Future Scope**  
1. **Wider Coverage**: Incorporate additional indices and companies for more comprehensive analysis.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate news and social media sentiment data for enhanced forecasting.  
3. **Natural Language Queries**: Enable users to interact with the dashboard using conversational queries.  
4. **Performance Optimization**: Enhance loading times and scalability for larger datasets.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the power of combining analytics and machine learning to gain actionable insights into the stock market. With real-time updates and predictive capabilities, the dashboard is a valuable tool for investors and analysts.
